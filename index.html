        <p class="lead mb-4">Film Making Major hoping to enter the cinematography industry after graduation. I may not be the best at directing and scriptwriting, but I believe I have an excellent array of work which shows my talent in cinematography by adding character to a moving picture by lighting and color correcting. <br><br>

        I have had experience with stills and layout not only with a camera but with photography. I got to experiment with filters and color correction and figured out my signature look and feel to my work. I have a strong feeling that my work will correlate well with your team and future projects. I have also had experience in all aspects of the Film Making process such as editing, lighting, scriptwriting, etc. Despite having production experience, my internship at A24, producing company, has also helped my gain perspective in the business side. Once upon a time, in a kingdom far, far away, the king and queen were blessed with a beautiful baby girl. And throughout the land, everyone was happy...until the sun went down and they saw that their daughter was cursed with a frightful enchantment that took hold each and every night. Desperate, they sought the help of a fairy godmother who had them lock the young princess away in a tower, there to await the kiss...of the handsome Prince Charming. It was he who would chance the perilous journey through blistering cold and scorching desert traveling for many days and nights, risking life and limb to reach the Dragon's keep. <br><br>

       For he was the bravest, and most handsome...in all the land. And it was destiny that his kiss would break the dreaded curse. He alone would climb to the highest room of the tallest tower to enter the princess's chambers, cross the room to her sleeping silhouette, pull back the gossamer curtains to find her...What? Princess... Fiona? No! Oh, thank heavens. Where is she? She's on her honeymoon. Honeymoon? With whom? She's on her honeymoon. Honeymoon? With whom? So she said what's the problem, baby? What's the problem? I don't know Well, maybe I'm in love Think about it every time I think 'bout it Can't stop thinking 'bout it How much longer will it take to cure this? Just to cure it, 'cause I can't ignore it If it's love, love Makes me wanna turn around and face me But I don't know nothing 'bout love Oh, come on, come on Turn a little faster Come on, come on The world will follow after Come on, come on Everybody's after love So I said I'm a snowball running Running down into this spring that's coming all this love Melting under blue skies belting out sunlight Shimmering love Well, baby, I surrender To the strawberry ice cream Never ever end of all this love Well, I didn't mean to do it But there's no escaping your love These lines of lightning mean we're never alone Never alone, no, no Come on, come on Jump a little higher Come on, come
